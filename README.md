# gromacs_smolagent
An HF's Smolagent to automate molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS.  
#### What is Gromacs?
[Gromacs](https://www.gromacs.org) is a popular, free and open-source software suite for high-performance molecular dynamics and output analysis.  
#### What is Smolagents?
[Smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) is a barebones library (around 1000 lines of code) from Hugging Face for agents that think in Python code. It is model-agnostic, tool-agnostic, and fully integrated with anything you can find in the Hugging Face's Hub.  
#### What is Hugging Face?
Seriuosly? If you are among the few dozens people in the world that have never heard of Hugging Face ðŸ¤—, please go discover that ecosystem [here](https://huggingface.co) before moving on with this repo.  
#### What's in this repo?
This repo provides a concrete example implementation of an AI agent using a lightweight library and an Open Source Small Language Model. The final implementation of this agent would automate setup, simulation and analysis tasks performed through the Gromacs tool.
